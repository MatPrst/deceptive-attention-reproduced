# Deceive with Attention-Based Explanations

This repository and paper have been conducted during the Fairness, Accountability, Confidentiality and Transparency (FACT) course at University of Amsterdam. 
Starting off with reproducing the original paper `Learning to Deceive with Attention-Based Explanations` we extend upon it with <TODO>.

## Environment Configuration

In order to run the code either create an Anaconda environment:

```
conda env create -f env.yml
```

or create a new environment and install all required packages with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Visualizing Results

We provide an IPython notebook detailing all results from our reproducibility report. 
Start your jupyter server and run all cells in `deceptive-attention/src/experiments.ipynb`to reproduce the reported results.

## Running Experiments

## Datasets

## Verifying the Implementation
