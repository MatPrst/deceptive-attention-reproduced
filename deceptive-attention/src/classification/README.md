# Classification Reproducibility

This subdirectory contains the necessary scripts to reproduce the classification experiments.

## Environment Configuration

In order to run the code either create an Anaconda environment:

```
conda env create -f ../../env.yml
```

## Reproducing Results

We provide an IPython notebook detailing all results from our reproducibility report.
